I'm going to list coins I think are worth watching here.

For now the goal is very simple: catch them early. It's like a game. Can we find coins debuting on Dexscreener that would make a profit, if I bought them at the time cited? Let's find out.

I'm using Dexscreener for this and monitoring only Solana for now. My top candidates are below, with price and timestamp at the time of writing.
