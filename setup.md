I'm going to list coins I think are worth watching here.

For now the goal is very simple: catch them early. It's like a game. Can we find coins debuting on Dexscreener that would make a profit, if I bought them at the time I listed them? Let's find out.

I'm using Dexscreener for this and monitoring only Solana for now. If I expand it will probably be to the Coinbase blockchain, called Base.

My top candidates are below, with price and timestamp at the time of writing.
